As the founder of the RSG RedM Framework which is a community-driven project that provides open-source code for the RedM community, I have started a collection of scripts that runs on this framework.
I aim to provide an addtional foundation for RedM servers, offering various features and systems that server owners can use and customize which are open-source and free.
